# Blockstack

[![Slack](http://slack.blockstack.org/badge.svg)](http://slack.blockstack.org/)

Blockstack is a new decentralized web. It enables users to register their usernames/identity without going through any third parties and
enables developers to build secure, server-less apps and publish them on the app store of this new decentralized web.

Blockstack provides a full stack of services to developers which include naming (like DNS), identity, auth, and storage.  

With the Blockstack software, a network of computers collectively maintain a global registry of names. When you run a Blockstack node, you join this network, which is more secure by design than traditional DNS and identity systems. This is because the system's registry and its records are secured by an underlying blockchain, which is extremely resilient against tampering and control.

In the registry that makes up Blockstack, each of the names has an owner, represented by a cryptographic keypair, and is associated with instructions for how DNS resolvers and other software should resolve the name.

Blockstack is already being used in production and currently [more than 60,000 names](https://resolver.onename.com/v2/namespaces) have been registered using it.

### Quick Installation

Run the following to install the Blockstack command line interface:

```
$ sudo pip install blockstack
```

Below is a system diagram of Blockstack. You can read more details about the system in [this](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack/blob/master/papers/blockstack_login16.pdf) USENIX Login article.

### Project Links

If you're just starting with Blockstack, here are the two main repositories you should checkout: 

- [Blockstack Core](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core) - the server that handles the core functionality of the decentralized domain name system and has an external storage system built-in for storing data records off-chain
- [Blockstack Client](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-client) - a CLI and client library that provides an interface for interacting with Blockstack servers and performing decentralized DNS operations

If you're already familiar with basic concepts of Blockstack, below are some repositories and tools that can help in building applications using Blockstack or to run your own services using Blockstack:

- [Virtualchain](https://github.com/blockstack/virtualchain) - a Python library for creating virtual blockchains on top of any underlying blockchain
- [Blockstack Auth JS](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-auth-js) and [Blockstack Auth Python](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-auth-python) - libraries that support generating, decoding and verifying auth request and auth response tokens

Most of these repositories are under heavy development and we appreciate any feedback, bug reports, or code contributions!
