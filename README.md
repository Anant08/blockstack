Blockstack is an open community of developers who are working to create a complete, standardized, well-documented toolkit for building decentralized applications.

The various components include data storage, secure naming, authentication, user identity verification, content ownership verification, and product trading.

This stack is completely decentralized and only uses open source software.

## How You Can Help
*Contribute code*
All Blockstack software is free and open source, so you can inspect every line of code and send us pull requests if you have any suggestions for ways the software can be improved. You can also file an issue if you find a bug and want to discuss ways it can be fixed.

*Debug Blockstack software*
Testing software and uncovering bugs around the edge cases is one of the most thankless tasks in software development, but someone’s gotta do it! We really appreciate and value our testers, and encourage people who want to support Blockstack to run the software and file issues in the appropriate repository for any bugs that are found.

*Improve documentation on any of our GitHub repositories*
It’s easy to focus so much on coding that documentation becomes out of date. While we try our best to keep our document informative, up-to-date, and easy to read, we could always use a fresh pair of eyes. If you think of a way that we could improve our documentation, please let us know!

*Organize community events*
It’s great to hang out and collaborate online, but it’s also important to sync up in person from time to time. In-person events help catalyze new ideas, new projects, and new relationships that can have a big impact on our lives, and this is no less true in the Blockstack community. These events don’t have to be big, fancy conferences - it could be as simple as a meetup at a local library or community center to discuss the latest Blockstack developments and applications with like-minded people from your area. Documents produced for past events are stored [here](https://github.com/blockstack/events/wiki), and we will continue adding more with each additional event that is organized by the community.

*Curate content for social media channels*
Our social channels rely on a steady stream of content from around the web about the latest in Blockstack, blockchain, and decentralized application development. If you find an article, blog post, project, video, podcast, or anything else online that you think would be of interest to the Blockstack community, share it via Twitter @blockstackorg or #blockstack, Slack, or the Blockstack forum so we can add it to our feed.

*Produce and share Blockstack content*
We want to continue reaching more people who are interested in decentralized application development, and this means producing a steady stream of content about Blockstack to attract new people to our community. If you have ideas or insights about Blockstack or decentralized application development in general, write them down and share it in the Blockstack forum - even better if you can have your post published on another site with an audience we might not reach otherwise. You can also help by sharing content produced by other members of the community on your website or social media accounts.

*Improve our website*
Just like the Blockstack software, the Blockstack website is [open source](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-site) too! We welcome any and all suggestions for how we can improve the website to make it more inviting and informative for visitors. Whether it’s creating an explainer or tutorial video, adding an infographic, or updating the copy, every little improvement helps.
