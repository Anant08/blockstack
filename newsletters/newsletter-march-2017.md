# #DecentralizeTheWeb Challenge Winners
  On February 16th Blockstack announced the submissions and winners of the #DecentralizeTheWeb challenge. The goal of the event was to get the Blockstack community involved in the creation of serverless apps and concepts. With only a few weeks heads up, we received some great submissions. Check out the recap here! 

# Blockstack CLI Video Tutorial Series

# Release of the New Blockstack Explorer
  In case you missed our earlier announcement, we launched Blockstack Explorer, a service for looking up info on Blockstack names and their associated addresses and transaction histories. Explorer gives a global view of all activity happening on the Blockstack network. It makes ownership of domains transparent and makes it easy for anyone to see the history of all domain name operations. Read the recent announcement blog post and try it out yourself by looking up your registered name in the .id namespace.

# AWS & FastSync

@Muneeb A let me know whether we’ll have this

MA: This is TBD given Amazon’s turn around time. I can work on the blog post and use my contact at AWS to speed things up.

# Search Integration

@Muneeb A 

MA: This is ready to be included. I can write a short description here.

# 14.1 Update
- Premiere of FastSync (@Jude N can you add a sentence here?)
- Premiere of RESTful API (@Jude N can you add a sentence here?)
- Alpha of Storage API (@Muneeb A should this be included?)

MA: Let’s take both the storage API and RESTful API out (RESTful can be separate release, it’s probably a blog post and the API is not defined/ready yet). We can give a summary of the v14.1 release notes and then link to the release notes on Github.
