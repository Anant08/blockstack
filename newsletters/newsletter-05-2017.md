*Blockstack Storage and Atlas Network Whitepaper*

*Decentralized Summer*

The core team is proud to announce a new developer program, "Blockstack's Decentralized Summer", running from June 1st - August 31st. The focus is on building decentralized applications that use identity, storage, and payments on the decentralized internet powered by Blockstack.
During this time you will build one of the first ten apps, like a decentralized twitter, uber, or voting system, that will be featured to over 70,000 decentralized app users. The Blockstack core team will work with you step-by-step via slack and weekly check-ins while you'll receive $6,000/mo. If you or someone you know is interested, visit [the Decentralized Summer page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockstacks-decentralized-summer-tickets-34395687427)

*Tor Integration*

Blockstack now has the ability to resolve Tor hidden services using human-readable names.  For example, instead of going to `3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion`, users can go to `duckduckgo_tor.id` to get to DuckDuckGo.

We have released a proof-of-concept here: https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-tor
