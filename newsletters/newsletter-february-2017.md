This month, there was an announcement of the new #DecentralizeTheWeb Challenge, a new release of Blockstack Core with code reorganization, a new private developer release of the Blockstack Browser, and a new release of the blockstack.org website. In addition, Mediachain is now building on Blockstack and Blockstack was covered in MIT Tech Review, CoinDesk and TechCrunch.##
DecentralizeTheWeb Challenge##

We're announcing a new worldwide online event on February 12th called the #DecentralizeTheWeb Challenge. To participate, develop a demo or concept of a decentralized, server-less application that can be built using blockstack.js, then submit an application along with a proof of concept. The winner will get an Oculus Rift. Apply here.
Blockstack Core Reorganization

Blockstack Core is undergoing a code reorganization that will make it easier for developers to run a Blockstack Core node. Formerly, there were two separate repositories comprising Blockstack Core - one for the blockchain indexer and one for the daemon, client, and storage drivers. Now they are being combined into a single repository, after code overlap and opportunities for simplification became clear. Now there's just one repository for the Blockstack Core reference implementation and running a node is cleaner and simpler than ever.

Blockstack Browser v0.2 Alpha

This week, the Blockstack team came out with a new developer release of the Blockstack Browser (codenamed Burgundy), which includes a brand new layout and a macOS application. Linux and Windows apps are coming soon and consumer versions of the browser will be distributed in future releases.

New blockstack.org Layout

The Blockstack website got a new layout this week, with a new landing page, a new intro page for Blockstack basics, a new blog page (we're migrating away from Medium), and a new layout for the videos page. That said, the new site isn't done yet, as a new design will be applied to the new layout in the next release.

Mediachain Builds on Blockstack

The Mediachain project, which provides a shared database for media content, released a new version of their software with Blockstack support. Medichain has integrated Blockstack DNS/naming and Blockstack Identity so that content creators on the system can tag their content and prove their identities.
