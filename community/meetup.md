# Host a Blockstack Meetup in your city

Here you can find the process for hosting a meetup in your city

## Getting Started

### Create meetup group 
First step is going to meetup.com and creating a group and title it "Blockstack [insert_your_city]" and establish yourself as the organizer. Alert @pstan26 in the issues of this repo and he'll join to be added as a co-organizer. If your country uses Facebook more often for things like this, feel free to create a facebook group.

### Meetup Description
Here's some sample copy you can use for the meetup description:

The decentralized internet on [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/) is powered by a technological breakthrough in consensus algorithms which allows you to take back your rights to ownership, privacy, and safety and to experience the internet as it was truly meant to be.

As a developer, you can build decentralized apps without having to set up any infrastructure or worry about hosting user data. The decentralized Blockstack network handles identity, auth, storage, and replaces DNS and TLS.

This meetup is all about building apps on the decentralized internet on Blockstack.

Blockstack is an open source project with over thousands of meetup members worldwide. Learn more about what Blockstack [here](https://blockstack.org/intro).

Add "blockstack" as one of the topic tags for this meetup.

### Picking your location and time
Finally get your first meetup scheduled with a location that can seat at least 30 people and we'll have a Blockstack Core team member visit or video in to present material. Create an issue in this repo tagging @pstan26 when you have found a date and location and we'll coordinate with you. Blockstack Org is happy to contribute to pizza and beverages.


### Planning the very first meetup topic
Typically its smart to start with an intro to Blockstack for the first meetup where we will have a presence. In the first meetup we'll cover:
- Intro to the decentralized internet powered by Blockstack
- Demo the Blockstack Broswer
- Show how to build fully decentralized apps with Blockstack

In the intro email you can encourage them to watch the video on [building decentralized single page javascript apps on blockstack](https://pusher.com/sessions/meetup/js-monthly-london/decentralizing-the-internet-with-serverless-single-page-javascript-apps) and show them the [Hello Blockstack Tutorial](https://blockstack.org/tutorials/hello-blockstack) which shows how to get started.
